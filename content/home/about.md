# About

I am Shizheng, an undergraduate student at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://www.nuaa.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate, I studied in Aircraft Power Engineering; with previous research experiences in machine-learning-assisted fluid mechanics (with member of National Academy of Engineering, [Prof. Earl H. Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) at [Duke University](https://mems.duke.edu/)) and application of Near-field Radiative Heat Transfer (with National "Thousand People Plan" Specially-invited Expert, [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&hl=en) at NUAA). 

__Now, I decided to join the group of [Prof. Hong jiarong](https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/jiarong-hong-s-group/home) in [UMN](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/) as a PhD student!__
