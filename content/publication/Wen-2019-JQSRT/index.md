**abstract**:

The capability of manipulating heat flux at the nanoscale has many promising applications in modern electronics and information processing industries. In this paper, a design to achieve ultrahigh thermal rectification is proposed based on near-field thermal radiation between nanoparticles made of intrinsic silicon and a dissimilar material. A record-high rectification ratio of more than 10000 is theoretically demonstrated, and the underlying mechanism lies in the prominent increase of imaginary part of dielectric function of intrinsic silicon induced by thermally excited electrons at high temperatures. Effects of gap distances, materials and configurations of nanoparticles on the rectification ratio are also investigated. This work may pave the way for the design of efficient thermal diodes, thermal transistors, and other thermotronics devices.

__Summary of this work:__

The development of modern electronics and information processing industries depends on the invention of electric diodes, which relies on the rectification of electrons flow. Nevertheless, due to the higher integration of circuits, the heat flux density has increased significantly. Subsequently, a high-temperature working condition may be resulted in, where electronic diodes tend to have low efficiency and even fail. On the other hand, heat flow can also be controlled, which may provide alternative ways to process information at harsh conditions. Thermal rectification is a phenomenon that allows heat flow in a more favorable direction. This phenomenon is promising to pave the way for the realization of future thermal diode/rectifier devices, and thus is attracting extensive attention.

Previous researches on thermal rectification were based primarily on conduction and convection. Alternatively, radiation-based thermal rectifiers, which can avoid contact and intrusion, have been conceived. The performance of thermal rectifier can be characterized by the thermal rectification ratio as R = (Qf – Qr)/Qr, where Qf and Qr represent net heat fluxes in the forward and reverse scenarios, respectively.

Although lots of researches have been done on this field, radiation-based thermal rectifiers still have a low rectification ratio compared with conduction-based counterparts, which can be as high as 100. Therefore, investigations on further improving the performance of radiation-based rectifiers are very imperative.

Here, we propose a radiation-based thermal rectifier configured by two nanoparticles made of intrinsic silicon (Si) and a dissimilar material. Maximum rectification ratios of 165.61 (intrinsic Si –3C-SiC) and 12,330 (intrinsic Si –doped Si), which are much higher than what reported in previous literature for noncontact thermal rectifiers, are predicted, as the sphere-sphere distance is varied. The underlying mechanism is attributed to the prominent increase of imaginary part of dielectric functions of silicon with temperature. Effects of gap distance, sphere radius, material types, shapes on the rectification performances are discussed.
