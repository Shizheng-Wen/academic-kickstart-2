# About

I am Shizheng, an undergraduate student at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate, I studied in Aircraft Power Engineering; with previous research experiences in Fluid Mechanics (with member of National Academy of Engineering, [Prof. Earl H. Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) at [Duke University](https://mems.duke.edu/)) and Near-field Radiative Heat Transfer (with National "Thousand People Plan" Specially-invited Expert, [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&hl=en) at NUAA).
