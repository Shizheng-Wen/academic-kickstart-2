# About

I am Shizheng, an undergraduate student at [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](http://iao.nuaa.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate, I studied in Aircraft Power Engineering; with previous research experiences in Fluid Mechanics (with member of National Academy of Engineering, [Prof. Earl H. Dowell](https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/earl-dowell) at [Duke University](https://mems.duke.edu/)) and Near-field Radiative Heat Transfer (with National "Thousand People Plan" Specially-invited Expert, [Prof. Xianglei Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RxW3otEAAAAJ&hl=en) at NUAA).
During my past three years, I have remained highly motivated in my research and studies and have been rewarded with outstanding academic performance. I rank 3/247 in my major, with Aâ€™s for all 7 mechanics courses and full marks for basic courses including mathematics and computer science. My past research experiences have spanned two disciplines (Applied Mechanics and Applied Physics), involving four different areas (fluid mechanics, machine learning, radiative heat transfer and nanotechnology). I have already finished two high-level papers (both as the first-author)
