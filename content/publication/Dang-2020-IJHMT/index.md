**abstract**:

Three-body structures have shown great potentials in enhancing the heat transfer rate and controlling the radiation spectrum in the near-field region, whereas are rarely considered in improving near-field radiative energy conversion performance. Here, a three-body thermophotovoltaic system configured by a tungsten emitter, a metallic spectral control layer, and a In0.18Sb0.82Ga photovoltaic cell is considered. By parameter optimization of the spectrum control layer, the efficiency and output power at the gap distance of 10 nm are enhanced from 24.7% and 188000 W/m2 to 43.9% and 608000 W/m2, respectively. The potential mechanism lies in the excitation of coupled surface plasmon polaritons of the metallic spectral control layer. This work paves the way for applications of three-body structure in thermophotovoltaic systems and designing high-performance energy conversion systems.
