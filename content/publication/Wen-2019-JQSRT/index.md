**abstract**:

The capability of manipulating heat flux at the nanoscale has many promising applications in modern electronics and information processing industries. In this paper, a design to achieve ultrahigh thermal rectification is proposed based on near-field thermal radiation between nanoparticles made of intrin- sic silicon and a dissimilar material. A record-high rectification ratio of more than 10 4 is theoretically demonstrated, and the underlying mechanism lies in the prominent increase of imaginary part of di- electric function of intrinsic silicon induced by thermally excited electrons at high temperatures. Effects of gap distances, materials and configurations of nanoparticles on the rectification ratio are also investi- gated. This work may pave the way for the design of efficient thermal diodes, thermal transistors, and other thermotronics devices.
