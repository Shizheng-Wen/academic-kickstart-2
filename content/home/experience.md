I became a member of [Aeroelasticity Group](http://aeroelasticity.pratt.duke.edu/) at Duke University in summer 2019. During the past three months, I worked closely with Prof. Earl Dowell and one of his PhD student Michael Lee on an approach to use machine learning in the context of complicated nonlinear dynamics flow. Particular, we are looking at something that engineering’s called buffet, which is the violent oscillation that occur over the flow around the aircraft. My job has led now to a first-author publication that has been submitted for consideration by a journal.

My friends collaborated with me on this project about the efficient near-field thermal photovoltaic system under the advisement of Prof. Xianglei Liu. In recent years, the research on near-field thermal photovoltaic cells has greatly improved the power and efficiency of the system. This work studied the changes in the performance of thermal photovoltaic cell system from the far-field to the near-field by adding filters between the emitter and semiconductor cells. Now, a co-author paper with my name is under preparation.

I became a member of [Energy Utilization, Conversation and Storage Lab (EUCS-Lab)]( http://www.eucs-lab.com/) under the advisement of Prof Xianglei Liu in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. My work was related to the application of near-field radiation in thermal rectifiers. Unlike the macro-scale thermal radiation determined by Planck’s law, we were more concerned with the radiative heat transfer at the nano/microscale and its application in modern electronics and information processing industries. More specifically, we were trying to design a high-performance thermal rectifiers, an analogy of electric diode, which can manipulate heat flux at nanoscale. My first-author work has already been published by the leading journal in radiative transfer, Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy & Radiative Transfer.
